BillSplit-iOS
=============

iPhone app that facilitates group cash splitting situations. 

Often times in group dining situations, some individuals are unable to pay the exact amount 
of their order due to not having enough "small change." With BillSplit, users can enter the 
cash that they own, and the menu items they ordered, in each of their own iPhones. 
Then, BillSplit will communicate with the devices and compile a list of transactions to 
rectify cash problems and at the same time pay the group bill.
